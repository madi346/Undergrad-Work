// input - what you put in

enter - the stock name  // hypothetical, just enter a random name for now
input - the stockbrokers name // if working for an actual company you would use the companies name
enter - price per share 
input - number of shares that were sold 

// processing - formulas used in the program 

 price per share >= $75, commission = $0.30 per # of share 
price per share < $75, commission = $0.20 per # of share 
if # of shares are > 200, commission is bonus of 0.10 + 0.30 per # of share 

 // Example, a broker sells 250 shares at a price of $100/share. Commission would be 250 * 0.30 = $75.00. 
// The broker would also get a bonus. Bonus = 75.00 * 0.1 = $7.50. Total commission would be 75.00 + 7.50 = $82.50

// output - your result

display - commission
display - bonus // if there is a bonus, if not it has a zero in its place
display - total commission
