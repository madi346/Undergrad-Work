Pseudocode for Exercise 1


// input 
enter an amount in dollars like 1.33 or 9.75, use decimals 
enter an amount you wish to have put into pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters 

// processing 
quarters = 0.25 
dimes = 0.10    
nickels = 0.05
pennies = 0.01

need a for loop
i = 0
 i < (greater than) denominations.length
i++

$1.44
144 pennies (times the 1.44 by 100)
144/25 = 5 quarters, 25 = 1 quarter 
5 * 25 = 125, subtract this from the 144
144 - 125 = 19
19/10 = 1, 10 = 1 dime 
10 * 1 = 10, subtract from the 19
19 - 10 = 9
9/5 = 1, 5 = 1 nickel
5 * 1 = 5, subtract from the 9
9 - 5 = 4
4/1 = 4, 1 = 1 penny, so there is 4 pennies 

in total there are 5 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies 

// output 
get amount in number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies



Pseudocode for Exercise 2

if amount is between 200 and 499, commission is 6%
if amount is between 500 and 999, commission is 8%
if amount is between more than 1000, commission is 10% 

// output 
get the total price 

for the tester values, the total prices are: 
214.42, 537.67, 1076.42, 1077.50
